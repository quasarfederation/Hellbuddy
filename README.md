Helldivers 2 Companion. Simple application that grabs data from the helldivers training manual API and displays it in a user-friendly way with tkinter (also uses pyglet for custom font). Can currently display: The current major order in game, info on all currently active planets (as in, all planets you are allowed to fight on in game), the last 10 messages sent from
the dispatch tab in game, and you can also grab info from any specific planet regardless of if you can fight on it or not, assuming you know the planet's name (case sensitive!)
